It's pretty simple and straightforward to use. The simulator can take either input texts or writings by yourself:

- I use `Grease Pencil` as the writing object holder, and `Layer` as the writing content holder.
- Remember to `Update Layer Tree` when you add new layers or delete layers.
- The preset **Writing Animation** and **Transform** is default added for each layer under `Layer Anim`, do the adjustment as you like.
